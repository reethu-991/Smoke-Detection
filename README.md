 This project discusses the various machine learning such as k-nearest neighbour & svm which were applied  to  the data  set.  It  utilizes the data such  as temperatue, humidity ..etc  then tries to predict the whether the fire is present or not.In this project, an IoT based fire alarm system is designed. It provides a message alert to the owner and fire  station  in  case  of  emergency.  This  research differentiates  states  of the  surroundings  in  terms of sleep,  passive  or  active  state  using  a  decision  tree algorithm. Hence a low cost, IoT system is developed which is ideal  as  a fire  safety solution  in residential areas and hospitals. In future developments, we will  add diverse sensors which can monitor other harmful gases produced. We will  also  further  develop  the  State  Determining algorithm to increase the scalability of the system. Later we  will  add  a  self  testing  module  which  will  self diagnose problems in  the alarm  system and alert the owner of a possible device failure.
